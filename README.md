# Lindesu's unity packages

### Delete entire lindesu asset folder before updating.

## Box Inventory: [https://youtu.be/6goS6GWG9Gs](https://youtu.be/6goS6GWG9Gs)
When you put your hand in the box when using an override, depending on what gesture you are using when your hand exits, a different item will be enabled.
## Button Inventory: [https://youtu.be/OtltuDNuuko](https://youtu.be/OtltuDNuuko)
A stop action, touch-based inventory system. Can be used to add an extreme amount of animations and objects to your avatar.
## Drop Bed: [https://youtu.be/WIYPGzzmFvM](https://youtu.be/WIYPGzzmFvM)
A mesh world particle bed which is 100% stable in world space with no position or rotation jitter. Oriented properly in local space using inherit velocity subemission and align to velocity rendering.
## Emote Switch: No preview yet
A prefab which will persistently enable/disable a child GameObject, started via emote override.
## Linear Projectile: [https://youtu.be/qZDQQjm6Gfc](https://youtu.be/qZDQQjm6Gfc)
A linear projectile with positional effects on collision. Uses stop action and looping root motion. Can be used to shoot an animated mesh. (This requires Final IK 1.71)
## Mixamo Gestures: No preview yet
These are the standard VRChat hand poses, free to use from Mixamo.
## Multi-Hand Trigger: [https://youtu.be/8-Xq4ycNmJo](https://youtu.be/8-Xq4ycNmJo)
Animate on a particular combination of gestures, *without* disabling child objects. Safe and reliable way to do state management with gestures.
## On-Release Trigger: [https://youtu.be/EjWEGT4HaTE](https://youtu.be/EjWEGT4HaTE)
Animate on gesture release, without disabling child objects.
## On-Slash Kit: [https://youtu.be/WybiF8HsR6U](https://youtu.be/WybiF8HsR6U)
Animate with the swing of your arm. Designed for slashing effects.
## Performance Cube: [https://youtu.be/SsiQx4IcqGc](https://youtu.be/SsiQx4IcqGc)
This is a big invisible cube. This will improve the sync rate of animator systems. Good for avatars which do performances and need consistency even if a person isn't looking at you.
## Physics Projectile: [https://youtu.be/opLUJeM8qqM](https://youtu.be/opLUJeM8qqM)
An object which is controlled by physics. You can easily replace the effects. Collides with the world using physics, but detonation is manual. Good example of an interface built with multi-hand trigger.
## Player Local Kit: No preview yet
Start particle systems or stop action animations that are player local.
## Single Fire Particle: No preview yet
This is a particle system prefab that will fire once per override, without garbage keyframes, without disabling game objects, without a broken emitter pair, without an animator, and without any visual interruption when you release the override. If you need a delay you can add it to the child particle, or other particles you decide to sub-emit.
## Sound On Collision: No preview yet
Play audio on the death of a particle. By default, the particle is set up to die on collision, and is managed by an override.
## Stop Action Kit: [https://youtu.be/eaWiAK0Nu4E](https://youtu.be/eaWiAK0Nu4E)
Perform collision-based animations. Animation on particle death.
## Suspend Animator: No preview yet
Blueprint animator for starting a persistent animated state.
## World Fixed IK: [https://youtu.be/1oL1ZNoKBxo](https://youtu.be/1oL1ZNoKBxo)
This is a world fixed object, held in place by a limb ik script connected to nothing. More stable than physics. *Can be combined with physics.* (This requires Final IK 1.71)
## World Fixed Joint: [https://youtu.be/k8CZ-pUoYv8](https://youtu.be/k8CZ-pUoYv8)
World fixed joint prefabs with integrated reset and 2017.4 bugfix. Emote and gesture prefabs.
